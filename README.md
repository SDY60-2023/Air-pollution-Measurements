# Air-pollution-Measurements

The measured substances are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides, lead, particulate matter, benzene, carbon monoxide and ozone as well as certain heavy metals. The Environmental Protection Agency has signed an agreement with DCE under which DCE is responsible for the measurements.

The measurements allow the Environmental Protection Agency to keep a watch over the air quality. Limits for acceptable levels of air pollution have been set in order to protect the population from the dangerous effects of pollution on health. Limit values have thus been determined for each of the above-mentioned substances.

Denmark meets the limit values for most substances, however extra effort is required with regard to particles and NO2 . Measurements are taken in the Copenhagen area, Aarhus, Odense and Aalborg and at several measuring stations outside the cities.
